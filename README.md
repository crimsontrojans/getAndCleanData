Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
========================================

## Files

The current file `README.md` describes the content of this repository: the R script, readme and code book files for the Coursera course project from Getting and Cleaning Data.

The R script `run_analysis.R` performs the steps to clean data, as described in https://class.coursera.org/getdata-013/human_grading/view/courses/973500/assessments/3/submissions

It can run as long as it is in the main directory and as long as the Samsung data is in the working directory (the submission requirement).

To run the code:

* download the data (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and unzip into a folder on your local drive

* Put run_analysis.R file into the unzipped ‘UCI HAR Dataset’ folder

The cook book `CodeBook.md` describes the variables and analyses done to clean the data.
